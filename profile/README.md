# Welcome
We are team of engineers, who are going to make the engineering world convenient for the data science guys.

We are DS advocates.

## SinaraML Framework - framework for creating and operating DSML platforms
- From the first sight of a Data Scientist with Sinara to receiving the first Docker image with a model accessible via REST, it will take 15 minutes only.
- SinaraML framework provides Sinara Server, Sinara Storage, Sinara Lib, Sinara Step Template, Sinara Tools to the Data Scientist.
- Sinara Server is a Jupyter Server, with all the necessary libraries for working with data and training models.
- Sinara Storage is a longterm storage where ML pipeline stored input and output entities. Depending on infrastuctuse Sinara Storage can be implemented based on S3, HDFS protocols or local disk.
- Sinara Lib is a compact library that contains everything you need to create ML pipelines, for data preparation and versioning, model versioning and serving.
- Sinara Template is a component template for creating a Sinara Step - an ML pipeline step. The ML pipeline consists of several steps. Each step based on this template.
- Sinara CLI - number of CLI tools for creating, deleting, stopping and starting a Sinara Server, creating docker images from BentoServices created by ML pipelines, ML pipelines management, vizualisation etc.
- [Sinara Tutorials](https://github.com/4-DS/sinara-tutorials/wiki/Getting-started) and [Sinara Book](https://sinara-definitive-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

To get started with Sinara, check out Sinara Tutorials. If you want to dive deep into the development of ML products, then Sinara Book is available for you. If you want to create a development process based on Sinara, check out the Sinara Dev Process.
