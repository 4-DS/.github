# Welcome
We are team of engineers, who are making the engineering world convenient for the data science guys.

We are DS advocates. Let us introduce SinaraML Framework to you.

## SinaraML is a lightweight open source framework that simplifies Data Scientist's work and eliminates pain of accompanying engineering routines

Like many others, SinaraML designed as a full-stack MLOps solution that allows you to focus on machine learning code development and takes care of the engineering tasks associated with scaling, reproducibility, model maintenance, data tracking, and experiment management.

But unlike other similar solutions SinaraML is many more. It is next generation MLOps framework incorporated with ready to use MLOps platforms. From one side to work in platform you don't need to setup servers neither you no need cloud provider - you are fully independent. You can start develop you code [just now]() on you WIndows or Linix desktop or VM. From the other side SinaraML Framework ready for  full-blown corporate MLOps sulution. SinaraML Framework provides abstractions to connect corporate storage (like S3/HDFS), corporate servers for spark clusters (for PandasOnSpark), corporate Git and CI/Ð¡D tools. Once written your ML code fully transferable beetween all of these platforms. So, you can start development on your desktop and continue in the corporate MLOps platform.

SinaraML doesn't require you to learn its own API for reading/writing data, managing experiments, or logging as previous generation platforms require. You don't have to constantly remember tracking or logging tasks by inserting special strings into your ML code. All you need is to insert cell in the beginning of notebook with inputs and outputs definitions. So the time from the first acquaintance to the launch of the first pipeline takes no more than 15 minutes. [tutorial link]()

SinaraML is a thin wrapper around the technologies of de facto standards in the field of machine learning and data engineering: Python, Jupyter, PandasOnSpark, CUDA, etc. Plus, SinaraML precisely closes the gaps that arise when integrating these technologies. 

SinaraML brings together the best of different worlds:

- Functionality of experiment management solutions such as MLFlow;
- Flexibility and simplicity Jupyter Notebooks for data and ML experiments visualization and logging
- Scalability and power of Spark for Data Engineering
- Flexibility of ETL for working with data
- Out of the box automatic data versioning and traceability (Data Lineage across all ML Pipeline)
- Model Serving by Data Scientist. Data scientists build Docker Images with REST interface without special knowledge about Docker, K8s, SinaraML APIs and REST frameworks. The resulting docker images do not require special infrastructure like as K8s or SinaraML servers and can run on any machine with docker installed.
- Out of the box are up to date, carefully selected Python envs for developing both classic ML and Computer Vision model 

The SinaraML framework not only addresses the needs of Data Scientists, but also the needs of MLOps engineers. SinaraML has an architecture with minimal operating costs. The platform relies heavily on the stateless servers, and the corporate MLOps platform can be implemented without relational and NoSQL DBMS
