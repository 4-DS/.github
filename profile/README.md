# Welcome
Let us introduce our team of engineers, who have over 10 years of vast experience behind them. We don't want to impose our beliefs on the practitioners of data science. We are going to make the engineering world convenient for the data science guys.

We are DS advocates.

## SinaraML Framework - framework for creating and operating DSML platforms
- From the first sight of a Data Scientist with Sinara to receiving the first Docker image with a model accessible via REST, it will take only 15 minutes.
- Sinara provides Sinara Server, Sinara Storage, Sinara Lib, Sinara Step Template, Sinara Tools at the disposal of the Data Scientist.
- Sinara Server is a Jupyter Server, with all the necessary libraries for working with data and training models.
- Sinara Storage is a storage for data, editable code in Jupyter Notebook and temporary files.
- Sinara Lib is a compact library that contains everything you need to create ML pipelines, for data preparation and versioning, model packaging and preprocessing/postprocessing in a Docker Container with REST interface.
- Sinara template is a component template for creating a Sinara Step - an ML pipeline step. The ML pipeline consists of several steps. Each step based on a template.
- Sinara Tools - tools for creating, deleting, stopping and starting a sinara server, creating docker images from BentoServices created by ML pipelines.

To get started with Sinara, check out Sinara Tutorials. If you want to dive deep into the development of ML products, then Sinara Book is available for you. If you want to create a development process based on Sinara, check out the Sinara Dev Process.
