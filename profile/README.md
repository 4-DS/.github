# Welcome
We are team of engineers, who are making the engineering world convenient for the data science guys.

We are DS advocates. Let us introduce SinaraML Framework to you.

## SinaraML Framework is a framework for creating and operating MLOps platforms
From the first sight of a Data Scientist with SinaraML to receiving the first Docker image with a model accessible via REST, it will take 15 minutes only.

SinaraML Framework provides SinaraML Server, SinaraML Storage, SinaraML Lib, SinaraML Step Template and other SinaraML tools and methodologies to the Data Scientist.

- **SinaraML Server** is a Jupyter Server, with all the necessary libraries for working with data and training models. SinaraML provides three Basic Servers for different purposes — classic ML, computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP).
- **SinaraML Storage** is a long-term storage where ML pipeline stored input and output entities. Depending on infrastructure Sinara Storage can be implemented based on S3, HDFS protocols or local disk.
- **SinaraML Spark** (pandas_api) is a effective and uniform way to work with big data sets using Apache Spark. Pandas_api gives Apache Spark's effectivenes and familiar pandas datasets functions.
- **SinaraML Lib** is a compact library that contains everything you need to create ML pipelines, for data preparation and versioning, model versioning and serving.
- **SinaraML Step Template** is a component template for creating a SinaraML Step — an ML pipeline step. The ML pipeline consists of several steps. Each step based on this template.
- **SinaraML CLI** is a number of CLI tools for creating, deleting, stopping and starting a Sinara Server, creating docker images from BentoServices created by ML pipelines, ML pipelines management, visualization etc.
- **SinaraML Basic** is a preconfigured personal MLOps platform working on desktop, remote virtual machine which can be located on-prem or on clouds like Google Collab/DataProc + Google Objecs, Azure DataBricks + Azure Blobs, Yandex DataSphere/DataProc + S3 etc.
- **SinaraML Customizable Infra** is a way to customize orchestration of Sinara Server, Sinara Storage and Sinara Spark for integration with your infrastructure (Git, Docker repos, authentication and authorization methods including Active Directory).
- **SinaraML Customizable Dev Process** is a way to configure Sinara Template and Sinara Step for your development process.
- **SinaraML Examples** is a library of ready to use configurable ML pipelines can be customized for your needs.
- [**SinaraML Book**](https://sinara-definitive-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) allows you to dive deeply into the development of ML products with SinaraML examples.
