# Welcome
We are team of engineers, who are making the engineering world convenient for the data science guys.

We are DS advocates. Let us introduce SinaraML Framework to you.

## SinaraML Framework - framework for creating and operating DSML platforms
- From the first sight of a Data Scientist with Sinara to receiving the first Docker image with a model accessible via REST, it will take 15 minutes only.
- SinaraML framework provides Sinara Server, Sinara Storage, Sinara Lib, Sinara Step Template, Sinara Tools to the Data Scientist.
- Sinara Server is a Jupyter Server, with all the necessary libraries for working with data and training models. SinaraML provides tree Basic Servers for different purposes - classic ML, computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP).
- Sinara Storage is a long-term storage where ML pipeline stored input and output entities. Depending on infrastructure Sinara Storage can be implemented based on S3, HDFS protocols or local disk.
- Sinara Lib is a compact library that contains everything you need to create ML pipelines, for data preparation and versioning, model versioning and serving.
- Sinara Template is a component template for creating a Sinara Step - an ML pipeline step. The ML pipeline consists of several steps. Each step based on this template.
- Sinara CLI - number of CLI tools for creating, deleting, stopping and starting a Sinara Server, creating docker images from BentoServices created by ML pipelines, ML pipelines management, visualization etc.
- Sinara ML Basic - preconfigured personal platform working on desktop, remote virtual machine which can be located on-prem or on a cloud.
- Sinara Customizable Infra - way to customize orchestration of Sinara Server, Sinara Storage and Sinara Spark for integration with your infrastructure (Git, Docker repos, authentication and authorization methods including Active Directory).
- Sinara Customizable development process - configure Sinara Template and Sinara Step for your development process.
- Sinara Examples - library of ready to use configurable ML pipelines can be customized for your needs.
- [Sinara Tutorials](https://github.com/4-DS/sinara-tutorials/wiki/Getting-started) and [Sinara Book](https://sinara-definitive-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
